### [Blackmores Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmore%27s_Night) : Way To Mandalay




I wandered down the pathway, through the misty moor  

Like I knew he did a thousand times before  

Voices seem to echo, "Come talk with me a while  

Just around the corner, just another mile"




I have heard the stories, her legend served her well  

A mystic's myth or fable, truth or fairy tale  

A raggle taggle gypsy , with a toothless smile  

Said, "Sit with me my darling, let's talk a little while"




And the road goes on  

Seeming ever longer on the way to Mandalay  

And the road goes on  

Forever will I wander on the way to Mandalay




The mile went on forever, the minutes turned to days  

Could I have been misguided by the mystic's ways?  

The moment lasts forever, at least it does for me  

Caught between what happened and what could never be




The road goes on  

Seeming ever longer on the way to Mandalay  

And the road goes on  

Forever will I wander on the way to Mandalay




And the road goes on  

Seeming ever longer on the way to Mandalay  

And the road goes on  

Forever will I wander on the way to Mandalay




And the road goes on  

Seeming ever longer on the way to Mandalay  

And the road goes on  

Forever will I wander on the way to Mandalay




Way to Mandalay
