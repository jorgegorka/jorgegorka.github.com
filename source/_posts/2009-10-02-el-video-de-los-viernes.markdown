### [Ayreon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayreon) -Come back to me


Let me take you back

To the time when we were chasing all the girls

Two maniacs

Indulging in the pleasures of this world

So much to see, so much to live for

Questions to answer, places to go

So much to be, so much to care for

Deep down inside I think you know

You are free...come back to me!

Look ahead and see

There are still so many borders we could cross

Just you and me

Making up for all the time that we have lost

[Best Friend]  So much to see

[Me] He may be right

[Best Friend]  so much to live for

[Me] I've got to fight

[Best Friend] Questions to answer

[Me] I will pull through

[Best Friend] places to go

[Me] take me with you

[Best Friend] So much to be

[Me] I will not break

[Best Friend] so much to care for

[Me] I must awake

[Best Friend] Deep down inside I think you know

[Me] I think I know

[Best Friend] You are free

[Me] I am free

[Best Friend] Come back to me!

[Best Friend] Aaaah, aaaah come back to me

[Me] There's no way out, my whole world is black!

[Best Friend] Aaaah, aaaah come back to me

[Me] I try to shout, something's holding me back!
